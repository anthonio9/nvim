= nvim

Simple, yet sufficient _nvim_ config made by _anthonio9_.

== How to put this together, so that I don't have to google again

.*Install _vim-plug_*

[source, bash]
----
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
----

Open `nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim` and run `:PlugInstall`.

.*Install _coc-clangd_ for C/C++ development*

Run `:CocInstall coc-clangd`, if there's no `clangd` in your `$PATH`, you can run `:CocCommand clangd.install` to install the https://github.com/clangd/clangd/releases[latest release] from GitHub.

.*Install yarn*

[source, bash]
----
# manjaro
sudo pacman -S yarn
----

Move to `~/.local/share/nvim/plugged/coc.nvim` and run `yarn install`.

== How to update the plugin config? 

Run below command to list all the commit id's with a directory name

[subs+attributes]
 $ for dir in ./* ; do (cd "$dir" && echo $dir && git rev-parse HEAD); done 

== Enable shared clipboard

Shared clip board is enabled by default, however `xclip` package may need to be installed

[source, bash]
----
sudo pacman -S xclip
----
