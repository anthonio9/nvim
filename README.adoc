Simple, yet sufficient _nvim_ config made by _anthonio9_.

== How to put this together, so that I don't have to google again

Install _vim-plug_

[source, bash]
----
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
----

Open `nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim` and run `:PlugInstall`.

Install _coc-clangd_ for C/C++ development

Run `:CocInstall coc-clangd`, if there's no `clangd` in your `$PATH`, you can run `:CocCommand clangd.install` to install the https://github.com/clangd/clangd/releases[latest release] from GitHub.
